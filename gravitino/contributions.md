## Eric Chang’s contribution in `apache/gravitino` and `apache/gravitino-playground`

## **Integration Test Infrastructure**

- Implemented container suite management for PostgreSQL ([#3195](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/3195)) and MySQL ([#2813](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/2813)), significantly improving integration test speed and reducing resource consumption by sharing containers across test suites.

## **Ranger Docker Image Reliability**

- Developed a workflow to build Ranger from source and improved the Ranger Docker image build process to address incomplete upstream releases ([#3775](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/3775), [#3912](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/3912), [#7112](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/7112)), ensuring reliable and reproducible builds.

## **Hive Docker Image Optimization**

- Refactored the Hive Docker image to reduce its size by 420MB ([#3268](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/3268)), improving efficiency for both developers and CI environments.

## **gvfs-fuse Logging**

- Added a debug logging mechanism to gvfs-fuse ([#5905](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/5905)), enabling better diagnostics and easier troubleshooting.

## **Python Client Enhancements**

- Ported partition-related interfaces from the Java client to the Python client ([#5964](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/5964)), improved developer documentation ([#6888](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/6888)), and fixed versioning issues ([#6951](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/6951)), broadening Gravitino’s usability for Python developers.

## **Storage Performance Improvements**

- Optimized the retrieval of securable objects in RoleMetaService by introducing batch listing ([#6601](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/6601)), reducing SQL query overhead and improving backend performance.

## **CLI Usability**

- Enhanced the Gravitino CLI to support multiple output formats for tag operations ([#6847](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/pull/6847)), making it more user-friendly and versatile.

## **Gravitino Playground Kubernetes Support**

- Added Helm chart support ([#56](https://github.com/apache/gravitino-playground/pull/56)) and CI checks ([#111](https://github.com/apache/gravitino-playground/pull/111)) to Gravitino Playground, enabling users to deploy and manage Gravitino in Kubernetes environments and ensuring code quality.

## **Others**

- Review other contributors' PRs and issues, providing feedback and suggestions to improve code quality and project direction.

## **Summary**

My contributions span infrastructure, developer tooling, CI/CD, user experience, and documentation. I am proficient in a wide range of programming languages and tooling, which has enabled me to proactively identify bottlenecks and implement robust solutions across different areas of the project. By leveraging my diverse technical skill set, I have improved both the developer and user experience, directly increasing the reliability, performance, and accessibility of Gravitino and its ecosystem.
This breadth and impact, combined with my responsiveness to reviews and collaborative approach, demonstrate my readiness to serve as a committer. I am committed to continuing to provide technical leadership and dedication-across multiple languages and tools-to benefit the project and its community.
