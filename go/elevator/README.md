大樓共10層樓，2部電梯
電梯只可容納5人
每行經一層樓需耗時1秒
每停一次處理接人放人需耗1秒
每秒產生1個人按電梯，設定出現樓層與目標的樓層，樓層隨機
若電梯剛到該樓層，馬上按電梯，電梯不停
模擬放進40人次，該設計需消耗掉所有人數，並統計秒數

10 floors in a building, each building has 2 elevators.

Every elevator can contain 5 people.

Go through every floor can take 1 second.

Every time elevator need 1 second to stop at a floor to catch / release people.

Every second should produce 1 person to use the elevator, set current floor and target floor in random.

If a person press button right after elevator arrived, the elevator won't stop.  

Simulate 40 people, and calculate elapsed time.
